simple maze solving algorithm with a cool interface in forms to see in real time the resolution working its magic!
the maze is loaded in text format
at defaut the walls are # and the path is . start and end are S/E.

a few maze models are also in the files.

feel free to alter or copy any part that seems relevant to your own applications :)
